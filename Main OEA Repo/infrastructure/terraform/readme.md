# Terraform
Terraform is built into Azure Cloud Shell and authenticated to your subscription.

You can also build and test modules in Azure with the Azure Terraform extension for VS Code, providing Terraform command support, resource graph visualization, and Azure Cloud Shell integration directly within VS Code.
