# OEA Framework
This is the set of assets that comprise the core Open Education Analytics framework.
Assets include:
- The core OEA library which is built in python and for now is packaged as a spark notebook. In future releases this core library will be packaged and installable from a Package Index.
- Common datasets, for use in commonly defined pipelines
- Example synapse pipelines that can be easily cloned and tweaked as needed
