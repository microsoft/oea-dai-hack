# packages
A package in the OpenEduAnalytics architecture is a set of assets that work with multiple data sources.
In other words, a package has dependencies on one or more modules.

Modules and packages have the same set of assets, but modules are self-contained while packages are dependent on one or more modules.

Modules are effectively building blocks with some sample assets of how that data can be used.
Packages are a more complete, more interesting, more valuable set of assets because they build on the data made available through the modules it uses.
