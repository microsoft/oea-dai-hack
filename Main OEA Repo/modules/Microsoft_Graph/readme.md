# Microsoft Graph module
We plan to publish these assets soon - until then, here is a brief doc that describes how to create an integration pipeline and how to process the json data that is returned: [Setting up a Graph API pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/OpenEduAnalytics/blob/main/modules/Microsoft_Graph/docs/Graph_API_Pipeline.pdf)


Once fully published, this module will provide:
* data extraction pipelines demonstrating how to utilize Azure Data Factory to pull data from the [Graph API](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph)
* example data sets that demonstrate the json format that the data will come in
* Synapse notebooks that demonstrate how the json data landed in stage 1 of the data lake can be processed and landed as parquet in stage 2 of the data lake
* A simple Power BI report that demonstrates how to connect to your data lake and construct a semantic model and basic report on the data from the Graph API

# A word about Graph data connect...
[Microsoft Graph data connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/data-connect-concept-overview) provides access to [some M365 data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/data-connect-datasets) at scale, using Azure Data Factory.

This module demonstrates the use of Graph API only - for an example of how to use data connect with Azure Data Factory, see: [msgraph-training-dataconnect](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-training-dataconnect)
