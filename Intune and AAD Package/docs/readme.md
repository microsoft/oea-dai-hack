# Documents and Images

- Upload documents with detailed information on ingesting, structuring and getting the data into the data lake. This can include PDFs that have screenshots and explanations on the steps for performing tasks. For example, setting up a data pipeline for ingesting data from an API to Synapse, guidelines for using the module in a production environment, the number of days that data can be pulled from a data source, etc. The docs folder can also include files like a module guide, diagrams, etc.
- Add all images to this folder and reference them in the various readme files.
